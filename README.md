# Planets Navigation Project

## Overview
This project is a simple webpage that allows users to navigate through a list of the eight planets in our solar system. The webpage is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and provides interactive functionality for users to view details of each planet, such as its name, type (inner or outer planet), diameter, and color.

## Objectives
- Learn how to manipulate the DOM using JavaScript.
- Create and interact with an array of planet objects.
- Use event handling to navigate through the planets.
- Update HTML elements dynamically based on JavaScript data.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Provides the basic structure of the webpage.
- **CSS**: Styles the HTML elements and creates visual representations of planets.
- **JavaScript**: Implements the functionality to navigate through the planets.

## Project Structure
- **index.html**: Contains the main HTML structure of the webpage.
- **styles.css**: Contains the CSS styles for the webpage.
- **script.js**: Contains the JavaScript code that provides the functionality.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Make sure all three files (**index.html**, **styles.css**, **script.js**) are in the same directory.
3. Open **index.html** in a browser to view the webpage.

## Features
1. **Planet Array**: A list of eight planet objects, each with properties like name, type (inner/outer), diameter, and color.
2. **Next and Previous Buttons**: Use these buttons to navigate through the list of planets.
3. **Planet Display**: The webpage displays the current planet's name, type (inner or outer), and a visual representation of the planet.

## Usage
- Click the **Next** button to move to the next planet in the solar system.
- Click the **Previous** button to go back to the previous planet.
- View the planet information and visual representation that updates accordingly.

## Future Enhancements
- Add a description of each planet to provide more information to the users.
- Add animations for transitioning between planets.
- Allow users to navigate directly to a planet by selecting it from a dropdown menu.
